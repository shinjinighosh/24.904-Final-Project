bangla reduplication types:

- adjectives to imply plural/many; "there were many small small flowers"
- emphasis; "can you speak slowly slowly?", "walk faster faster"?
	- these also have a time component but other adverbs don't
- "dog dog fight" -> fighting among the dogs
- continuous meaning in subordinate clause verbs; "while she was going going" 
- morphological for onomatopoeia / describing sensations ("stinging pain", 
describing amount of rain - moderate, trickle, cats & dogs)
	- these words aren't usually used alone, but when they are they mean the same thing 
  ("that place throbs. throb throb pain" "there was a thok sound. thok thok sound")
- reduplication with first consonant of second word changed to mean etcetera (other languages 
do this too, but with different first consonants)
	- only done with a specific category of common consonants - almost always gets replaced with t, 
  but what the word is changes whether it's the retroflex vs alveolar t
- indicating action from a perspective "they sat together together", "they beat beat each other" 
(because there are two people?)
	- in this situation, the verb conjugation stays, but the last vowel of the 1st redup. changes to a
  and the last vowel of the 2nd changes to i (note: opposite of the pattern in English! ping-pong,
  tick-tock, flim-flam etc.)
	- children might sometimes reduplicate in a correct situation, but not change the vowel correctly
- there are more options, but other categories end up collapsing into these eventually

Experimental idea based on this:
- when do kids realize that 'quickly quickly' might sometimes just mean "come quickly" but sometimes would 
signal a tense change --> which would they think it meant? could provide different situations: one where either 
could be true, and one where one thing is privileged, and see if that changes their interpretations
- this could be an interesting look at children's first assumptions about what words in those positions are 
"supposed" to mean

More concretely:
- show one picture of many small flowers and one picture with a few tiny flowers, ask "can you show me 
the small small flowers"? 
- have a puppet describe a picture with either many small flowers or a few tiny ones (and something 
else for scale I guess?) and say "oh there are small small flowers!" and see if the children think the 
puppet is right or wrong
- these two together would let us see 1. what children think when making their own judgements 
2. if that holds when they are presented with evidence that one judgement or the other is specifically correct
