Background Research
===================================================================

/TODO/
Summary of Ota & Skarabela (2017): This paper investigates the hypothesis that
very early infant word learning and segmentation is aided by word and syllable
reduplication (e.g. 'mama' or 'choo-choo'). Other studies showed some advantage
for infants in learning reduplicative words, but none explicitly tested whether
it improves infants' ability to perform word segmentation. The study exposed
nine-month-old native English learners to two different spoken passages,
each containing a novel four-letter CVCV word chosen to be similar to English words
phonetically. One word was reduplicative (the first CV syllable was the same as
the second) and one had two different syllables. Next, they played those two words,
as well as an additional two novel words the infants had not heard before.
They found that the infants listened equally to the two newest words and
to the original non-reduplicative word, but longer to the original reduplicated word.
_that sentence is a bit awkward, rephrase if you have a better way to say it_
_will do!_
That implies that the infants had only learned the reduplicated word despite
being exposed to both equally. The authors' conclusion is that reduplication
does indeed improve infants' ability to perform word segmentation.
