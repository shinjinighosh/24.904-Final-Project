# Topic
/work exists on Bangla reduplication rules/
/work exists on Bangla reduplication functionalities/classifications/
/work exists on child learning of reduplication/

/can do something about is reduplication its own thing, or is it specific to aspects, broken down
by functionality and parts of speech? ft. Bangla/



# Background Research

## Summary of Ota & Skarabela (2017):
This paper investigates the hypothesis that
very early infant word learning and segmentation is aided by word and syllable
reduplication (e.g. 'mama' or 'choo-choo'). Other studies showed some advantage
for infants in learning reduplicative words, but none explicitly tested whether
it improves infants' ability to perform word segmentation. The study exposed
nine-month-old native English learners to two different spoken passages,
each containing a novel four-letter CVCV word chosen to be similar to English words
phonetically. One word was reduplicative (the first CV syllable was the same as
the second) and one had two different syllables. Next, they played those two words,
as well as an additional two novel words the infants had not heard before.
They found that the infants listened equally long to the two newest words and
to the original non-reduplicative word, but listened longer
or paid more attention to the original reduplicated word.
That implies that the infants had only learned the reduplicated word despite
being exposed to both equally. The authors' conclusion is that reduplication
does indeed improve infants' ability to perform word segmentation.

## Summary of Bandyopadhyay and Chakraborty (2010):
A rule-based approach has been used in two phases,
the general expression level and the structural and semantic classifications. Notably, the authors
found eight classes of reduplication at the 'sense' level, implying that there are multiple
different functionalities of Bengali reduplication. Moreover, a rule-based system yielded on an
average, over 90% precision, recall and f-score values, implying that it might also be
possible for young children to apply similar segmentation using similar rules.

## Summary of Senapati and Garain (2015):
The authors have studied
the frequencies in which reduplicated words appear in Bengali. They
have proposed an algorithm to identify the
reduplicated words from a text corpus as well as a dictionary-based tuning
technique to enhance the accuracy of identifying such words in the corpus.

## Summary of (Anonymous):
A chapter on Bangla reduplication has provided 11 classifications of Bangla reduplications, based
on various aspects. It would be interesting to look at how children truly classify it while
 learning.
